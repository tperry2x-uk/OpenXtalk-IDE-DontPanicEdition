# libSVGicons
This is a library meant to compliment the IconSVG library in the IDE.

A main feature is support for loading SVG Icon sets stored in a simple
tab-seperated-values (TSV) list. These TSV Icon lists can be created from
"-webfont.svg" formated font commonly found on the internet and supported by
tools such as the cross-platform, open-source fontForge application.

Included with the library are several liberally licensed Icon sets, the biggest    
of these sets being Google's Material Icon project (v.4.0 currently).
Material Icons set contains 6,063 glyphs so there may be a slight delay
(0.5 second or so) when initially loading that set.
