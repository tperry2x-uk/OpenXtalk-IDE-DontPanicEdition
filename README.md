## The OpenXTalk DON'T PANIC Edition! Inegrated Development Environment

This project is part of an effort to maintain and improve a fork of the legacy open source (GPL3) LiveCode Community Edition code base.
LiveCode Ltd. has dropped support for opensource builds (LCC 6.0.1 to 9.6.3) entirely. 
### This means DO NOT ASK LC Ltd. for support for things related to this project in anyway!

For those that may be unfamiliar with the term, xTalk is a family of scripting languages that aspires to be natural-language-esque, syntactically English-like, "programming for the rest of us". "Xtalk" stems from Dan Winkler's HyperTalk "Script" language used in Bill Atkinson's now long-defuct HyperCard developed at Apple / Claris from 1987 to 1998. Some of the concepts in HyperCard originated decades before HyperCard appeared, the "Hyper" in the name stemms from the concept of HyperText / HyperMedia, terms first coined in the 1960s. But HyperCard implemented many these concepts before the first web browser was developed, and has been cited as inspiration for many a modern day internet and programming things some now take for granted. Wikipedia, for example, was first implemented as HyperCard stacks.

This project is split into two main repos. This repo is for the integrated development environment (IDE) portion, the front-end that users see. The IDE is, in large part bootstrapped (built with itself), and so in order to make changes, those interested in contributing only need to know LiveCode Script Language or perhaps one of the other xTalk scripting languages (HyperTalk, SuperTalk, MediaTalk, Lingo, SenseTalk, OpenXION, etc.)
